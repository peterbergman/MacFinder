MacFinder
=========
A project developed during the course "Internet programming - Stationary units". 

The system works like the "Find my Mac" feature. It consists of 3 main components:
- An agent that installs on a OSX machine
- A client that can be used to display the location of the machine on a map
- A server that both the agent and the client talks to
